Program 1:
Class Test has an integer array which stores marks of various tests. For example, if the array is marks[] then marks[1] stores the marks of subject1, marks[2] stores the marks for subject2 and so on.
Overload the subscript operator so that you can compare the marks of each subject for two objects of the test class.

Program 2:
In a triangle, the sum of two sides is greater than the third. If we are given three values a, b ,c then a+b>c; b+c>a; c+a>b.
Write an exception class of your own in C++ that will be thrown if any one of the above conditions are not satisfied. Else evaluate the area of a triangle and display the output.

Program 3:
Classes fourwheeler and twowheeler inherit from the parent class vehicle. Class data members and member functions will depend on you. 
Hence each implementation is expected to be unique. Ultimate objective is to display the name and mileage of a 2 or 4 wheeler (along with other details of your choice) depending on user input. 
Since this is a program on inheritance design the program such that meaningful properties are inherited. Add Exception Handling To This Program.

Program 4:
Parent class 'shape' has a member variable side. Child classes 'square' and 'rectangle' inherit from the parent class. 
Calculate the area of square and rectangle and also add Exception Handling To This Program.
